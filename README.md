Professional Portfolio &amp; Blog

This is my professional portfolio, which will include a blog feature. The blog will be meant to document my learning/self-taught journey through web development. The portfolio will showcase my experience, knowledge and proficiency in languages/libraries/frameworks by featuring projects that I have worked/am working on.

Used .github.io for hosting.
